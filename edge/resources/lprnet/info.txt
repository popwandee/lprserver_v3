Hailo's license plate recognition network (lprnet) was trained in-house on a synthetic auto-generated dataset to predict registration numbers of license plates under various weather and lighting conditions.
Model Details
Architecture

    A convolutional network based on LPRNet, with several modifications:
        A ResNet like backbone with 4 stages, each containing 2 residual blocks
        Several kernel shape changes
        Maximal license plate length of 19 digits
        More details can be found here
    Number of parameters: 7.14M
    GMACS: 18.29
    Accuracy* : 99.96%
    * Evaluated on internal dataset containing 1178 images

Inputs

    RGB license plate image with size of 75x300x3
    Image normalization occurs on-chip

Outputs

    A tensor with size 5x19x11
        Post-processing outputs a tensor with size of 1x19x11
        The 11 channels contain logits scores for 11 classes (10 digits + blank class)
    A Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) greedy decoding outputs the final license plate number prediction

Training on Custom Dataset

    Hailo's LPRNet was trained on a synthetic auto-generated dataset containing 4 million license plate images. Auto-generation of synthetic data for training is cheap, allows one to obtain a large annotated dataset easily and can be adapted quickly for other domains
    A notebook for auto-generation of synthetic training data for LPRNet can be found here
    For more details on the training data autogeneration, please see the training guide
