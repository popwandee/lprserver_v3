# Contributing

- Read `instruction.md` and `.cursor/.cursorrules`
- Use path-scoped labels and commit scopes: `server`, `edge`, `share`, `docs`
- Keep changes small and focused; avoid cross-imports between server/edge
- Document env/config changes in `server/env.example` and `instruction.md`
- Use PR template and ensure CI (path-filtered) is green
